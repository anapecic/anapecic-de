        Diving headfirst into the world of frontend web development at the
        moment. Currently, I'm sharpening my skills at neuefischeâ€™s web
        development bootcamp, and I'm all about creating sleek, responsive web
        interfaces. With a solid background in digital marketing, large-scale
        social media projects, and influencer management, I'm super excited to
        bring that experience into tech. <br /> I'm passionate about using HTML,
        CSS, and JavaScript as well as a number of frameworks (React.js,
        Angular) to build awesome user experiences. If you're looking for
        someone to craft dynamic and accessible websites, let's connect and make
        something amazing together!
