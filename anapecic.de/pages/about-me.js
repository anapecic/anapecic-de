        Diving headfirst into the world of frontend web development at the
        moment. Currently, I&apos;m sharpening my skills at neuefische&rsquo;s
        web development bootcamp, and I&apos;m all about creating sleek,
        responsive web interfaces. With a solid background in digital marketing,
        large-scale social media projects, and influencer management, I&apos;m
        super excited to bring that experience into tech.

        I&apos;m passionate about using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as well as a
        number of frameworks (React.js, Angular) to build awesome user
        experiences. If you&apos;re looking for someone to craft dynamic and
        accessible websites, let&apos;s connect and make something amazing
        together!
